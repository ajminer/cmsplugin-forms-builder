django-cms>=3.0

# We originally created this fork for the "sites" repository to use
# for an additional migration needed, (and that we recently decided
# really should live within "sites" instead). But here, we are
# pointing at the fork since it merges some upstream changes, (such as
# depending on Django 1.9 not Django 1.8), that we need, and that are
# not yet in the most recent release (which is 0.12.2 as of the time
# of this writing).
